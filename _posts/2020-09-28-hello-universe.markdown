Greetings! Welcome to my blog!

This blog will mostly contain content involving computer Science, philosophy and mathematics—the three subjects that I am most interested about. As for which of the three I’m most interested in, I suppose it’d be computer science given that I am a CS student. For the other two, I’m not quite sure. I’d say they’re almost equally ranked.

In any case, I thought I’d start the first post with a traditional “Hello World!” program post. Incidentally, one had already been created as a placeholder, in fact! I thought I’d change it up a bit by replacing “World” with “Universe”. As for why this is, the reason lies in one phrase: “Goodbye Universe” which was used by one of the professors in my university in a few modules. I’m not sure where that’s from, but it’s a really fitting “exit” equivalent to “Hello World”. I tried to look it up and it doesn’t seem like this is a common phrase (if you know this, chances are, you’ll likely know who I’m talking about).

And that is all for the initial post. Goodbye Universe!
